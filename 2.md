### Here are some of the major characteristics of the new visionary computational ecosystems:

-   Global and fully p2p distributed. There will be no central authorities or players.
-   Secure, Private, Anonymous.
-   Ensured trust and ensured data integrity.
-   Cannot be destroyed or switched off.
-   Transparent.
-   Based on open source.
-   Open-ended, evolvable, high level of interoperability.
-   Semantically competent (in some of schemes).
-   Allows multiple approaches/philosophies to be implemented in code and communicate with each other.
-   Naturally accommodates artificial autonomous agents (i.e. robots, AIs, autonomous organizations).
