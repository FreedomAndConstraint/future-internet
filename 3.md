### Major players in the global computational ecosystem

1.  Ethereum - A distributed global virtual computer over the internet integrated via a blockchain protocol.
2.  Ceptre - A distributed computational ecosystem that integrates semantic computation, high level interoperability and data integrity scheme.
3.  MaidSafe - a distributed and secure file system that comes to replace servers with p2p model. Aims at an application layer in the future.
4.  IPFS - a p2p hypermedia protocol, that comes to replace servers with p2p model (Aims at an application layer in the future?).
5.  Also, we should not forget the 'traditional' players, e.g. [cloud computing utility providers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing_comparison#Cloud_computing_utility_providers). They hold enormous computing power and services which should not necessary be seen as 'competition' to the emerging technologies -- rather a leverage that can make them even more powerful.
